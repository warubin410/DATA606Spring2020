Last year, the average federal sentence for drug trafficking rose, and we are already seeing encouraging results. Preliminary data from the CDC shows that drug overdose deaths actually began to decline in late 2017 and opioid prescriptions fell significantly. We also saw an actual decline in homicides and violent crimes in 2017 after increases in 2015 and 2016.

Drug poisoning deaths are the leading cause of injury death in the United States; they are currently at their highest ever recorded level and, every year since 2011, have outnumbered deaths by firearms, motor vehicle crashes,\\xa0suicide, and homicide. In 2016, approximately 174 people died every day from drug poisoning.”', 'As the report also notes:', '“National and neighborhood-based street gangs and prison gangs continue to dominate the market for the street-sales and distribution of illicit drugs in their respective territories throughout the country. Struggle for control of these lucrative drug trafficking territories continues to be the largest factor fueling the street-gang violence facing local communities. . . . \\xa0Gangs’ desire to secure the largest share of the profits and the most lucrative territories for themselves drives violent turf wars that often result in the murder or attempted murder of rival gang members and drug dealers. Firearm-related violence will likely continue to be associated with the illicit drug trade due to the constant turf wars between gangs vying for control of territory. . . . Street gangs are increasingly distributing fentanyl and fentanyl-laced products as the drugs continue to flow into the United States. The monies involved with its street sale, and the demand for fentanyl by the consumers of illicit drugs, encourages gangs to become more involved with selling fentanyl.”']}\n",

The resolution – the largest recovery by the United States in a case concerning an opioid drug – includes the forfeiture of proceeds totaling $647 million, civil settlements with the federal government and the states totaling $700 million, and an administrative resolution with the Federal Trade Commission for $50 million.', 'Suboxone is a drug product approved for use by recovering opioid addicts to avoid or reduce withdrawal symptoms while they undergo treatment. Suboxone and its active ingredient, buprenorphine, are powerful and addictive opioids.\\xa0', '“The opioid epidemic continues to be a serious crisis for our nation, and I’m proud of the work the Department of Justice and our partners are doing to address this epidemic,” said Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Claire Murray.', '\\xa0“We are confronting the deadliest drug crisis in our nation’s history. Opioid withdrawal is difficult, painful, and sometimes dangerous; people struggling to overcome addiction face challenges that can often seem insurmountable,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt for the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “Drug manufacturers marketing products to help opioid addicts are expected to do so honestly and responsibly.”', 'Until December 2014, RB Group’s wholly owned subsidiary, Indivior Inc. (then known as Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.) marketed and sold Suboxone throughout the United States. In December 2014, RB Group spun off Indivior Inc., and the two companies are no longer affiliated. On April 9, a federal grand jury sitting in Abingdon, Virginia, indicted Indivior for allegedly engaging in an illicit nationwide scheme to increase prescriptions of Suboxone. The United States’ criminal trial against Indivior is scheduled to begin on May 11, 2020, in the United States District Court in Abingdon, Virginia. Indivior is presumed innocent until proven guilty.', 'To resolve its potential criminal liability stemming from the conduct alleged in the indictment of Indivior, RB Group has executed a non-prosecution agreement that requires the company to forfeit $647 million of proceeds it received from Indivior and not to manufacture, market, or sell Schedule I, II, or III controlled substances in the United States for three years. In addition, RB Group has agreed to cooperate fully with all investigations and prosecutions by the Department of Justice related, in any way, to Suboxone.', '“Today’s announcement demonstrates that this office will work tirelessly to address all facets of the opioid epidemic,” First Assistant United States Attorney Daniel P. Bubar of the Western District of Virginia said. “This historic resolution is the product of a continued partnership with the Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, FDA, HHS, and the U.S. Postal Service.”', '“This is a landmark moment in our fight to hold drug companies responsible for their role in the opioid crisis,” said Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring. “We will not allow anyone to put profits over people, or to exacerbate or exploit the opioid crisis for their own benefit. The Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit’s expertise, capacity, and diligent investigation, combined with strong relationships with local, state, and federal partners, helped make this resolution possible.”', '“Opioid addiction and abuse is an immense public health crisis and taking steps to address it is one the FDA’s highest priorities,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “Providing misleading information about product benefits puts the public at risk. We also are particularly concerned with schemes to game the drug approval process to prevent generic competition for important medicines. The FDA, including criminal investigators in our Office of Regulatory Affairs and the lawyers in our Office of Chief Counsel, will continue to work with the Department of Justice to investigate and hold accountable those who devise and participate in schemes to the detriment of the public health.”', '“The U.S. Postal Service spends billions of dollars per year in workers compensation-related costs, most of which are legitimate,” said Kenneth Cleevely, Special Agent in Charge of the Eastern Field Office for the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General. “However, when medical providers or companies choose to flout the rules and profit illegally, special agents with the USPS OIG will work with our law enforcement partners to hold them responsible. To report fraud or other criminal activity involving the Postal Service, contact our special agents at www.uspsoig.gov or 888-USPS-OIG.”', 'According to the indictment, Indivior—including during the time when it was a subsidiary of RB Group—promoted the film version of Suboxone (Suboxone Film) to physicians, pharmacists, Medicaid administrators, and others across the country as less-divertible and less-abusable and safer around children, families, and communities than other buprenorphine drugs, even though such claims have never been established.', 'The indictment further alleges that Indivior touted its “Here to Help” internet and telephone program as a resource for opioid-addicted patients. Instead, however, Indivior used the program, in part, to connect patients to doctors it knew were prescribing Suboxone and other opioids to more patients than allowed by federal law, at high doses, and in a careless and clinically unwarranted manner.', 'The indictment also alleges that, to further its scheme, Indivior announced a “discontinuance” of its tablet form of Suboxone based on supposed “concerns regarding pediatric exposure” to tablets, despite Indivior executives’ knowledge that the primary reason for the discontinuance was to delay the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of generic tablet forms of the drug.', 'The indictment alleges Indivior’s scheme was highly successful, fraudulently converting thousands of opioid-addicted patients over to Suboxone Film and causing state Medicaid programs to expand and maintain coverage of Suboxone Film at substantial cost to the government.', 'Under the civil settlement, RB Group has agreed to pay a total of $700 million to resolve claims that the marketing of Suboxone caused false claims to be submitted to government health care programs. The $700 million settlement amount includes $500 million to the federal government and up to $200 million to states that opt to participate in the agreement. The claims settled by the civil agreement are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability.', 'The civil settlement addresses allegations by the United States that, from 2010 through 2014, RB Group directly or through its subsidiaries knowingly: (a) promoted the sale and use of Suboxone to physicians who were writing prescriptions without any counseling or psychosocial support and for uses that were unsafe, ineffective, and medically unnecessary and that were often diverted for uses that lacked a legitimate medical purpose; (b) promoted the sale or use of Suboxone Film to physicians and state Medicaid agencies using false and misleading claims that Suboxone Film was less susceptible to diversion and abuse than other buprenorphine products and that Suboxone Film was less susceptible to accidental pediatric exposure than tablets; and (c) submitted a petition to the Food and Drug Administration on Sept. 25, 2012, claiming that Suboxone Tablet had been discontinued “due to safety concerns” about the tablet formulation of the drug and took other steps to delay the entry of generic competition for Suboxone in order to improperly control pricing of Suboxone, including pricing to federal healthcare programs.', '“With the nation continuing to battle the opioid crisis, the availability of quality addiction treatment options is critical. When treatment medications are used, it is essential they be prescribed carefully, legally, and based on accurate information, to protect the health and safety of patients in federal healthcare programs,” said Gary L. Cantrell, Deputy Inspector General for Investigations at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “Along with our federal and state law enforcement partners we will continue working to protect these vulnerable beneficiaries.”', '“Opioid manufacturers – like all drug manufacturers – have a duty to market their products both truthfully and safely,” said Craig Carpenito, U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. “Opioid manufacturers have an additional and critically important duty to maintain effective controls to prevent their highly dangerous products from being abused and diverted.”', '“The opioid crisis has caused devastation throughout the country, including in the lives of Federal employees, annuitants, and their families,” said Thomas W. South, Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations for the Office of Personnel Management.\\xa0“The OPM OIG is committed to working with the Department of Justice and our other law enforcement partners to combat this epidemic. As always, patient safety is our number one priority.”', 'The civil settlement resolves the claims against RB Group in six lawsuits pending in federal court in the Western District of Virginia and the District of New Jersey under the ', ', or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act, which allow private citizens to bring civil actions on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery.', 'Under a separate agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), RB Group has agreed to pay $50 million to resolve claims that it engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 53(b). The FTC is filing a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia alleging anticompetitive activities by RB Group designed to impede competition from generic equivalents of Suboxone. RB Group no longer manufactures or markets drug products. As part of a consent decree, RB Group agreed that it would notify the FTC if it began marketing drug products in the United States. RB Group further agreed that if it filed a Citizen Petition with the FDA in connection with a drug product, it would simultaneously disclose to both the FDA and the FTC all studies and data relevant to that Citizen Petition. RB Group further agreed not to withdraw a drug from the market or otherwise disadvantage a drug after obtaining approval to market another drug containing the same active ingredient.', '“Buprenorphine products are approved for use in the treatment of Americans struggling to overcome opioid addiction, and, in the middle of the nation’s opioid crisis, RB Group allegedly sought to deny those consumers a lower-cost generic alternative to maintain its lucrative monopoly on the branded drug,” said Gail Levine, a Deputy Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition.', 'The criminal resolution with RB Group was handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia and the Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch based on an investigation by the Virginia Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit; FDA - Office of Criminal Investigation; United States Postal Service – Office of Inspector General; and Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General. The civil settlement was handled by the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey. Assistance was provided by representatives of the HHS Office of Counsel to the Inspector General; the HHS Office of the General Counsel, CMS Division; FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel; the U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of the General Counsel; the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; the Office of Personnel Management - Office of Inspector General; the Department of Veterans’ Affairs Office of Inspector General; the Department of Labor - Office of Inspector General; and TRICARE Program Integrity.']}\n",

Despite its staggering natural beauty, northern New Mexico, and Espanola, New Mexico in particular, has one of the highest opioid overdose death rates in the country. For decades, Espanola has had a severe heroin problem.\\xa0 And as you may know, Espanola is surrounded by Indian reservations. Many New Mexico Indian Pueblos, including the Pueblos of Santa Clara, Ohkay Owingeh, San Ildefonso, Picuris, Pojoaque, Nambe and Tesuque are all within a short distance of the Espanola area.\\xa0 The opioid epidemic knows no boundaries, and so our Pueblos are equally affected by heroin and prescription opioids; individuals and communities alike continue to be plagued by the opioid scourge and its secondary effects.', 'At a recent consultation in New Mexico, one Pueblo Governor shared photographs of the parking lot of their casino. The photos revealed discarded needles, syringes and other drug paraphernalia scattered about the casino parking lot.\\xa0\\xa0', 'At the same consultation, a Pueblo Chief of Police emotionally described losing a brother to a heroin overdose and a sister to a prescription opioid overdose.\\xa0 The Chief of Police explained that the drug epidemic is dire in Northern New Mexico and that something needs to be done to address the problem.', 'The catastrophic impact that opioid abuse can have at every level of a community, from family units to infrastructure and economic stability, demands our best efforts to put forth effective and sustainable support to communities in crisis.\\xa0 The Department has developed a multi-faceted response to addressing the threat and the impact of opioid abuse.\\xa0 Our approach in Indian country is based on the belief that the Tribes are in the best position to identify solutions to problems in their communities.\\xa0 We have sought to develop resources and initiatives that rely on partnership with the Tribes and are continually interested in hearing from our Tribal and federal partners as we adjust our efforts to better meet the needs of Native communities.\\xa0 \\xa0', 'An important element of the Department’s support is in providing opportunities for funding.\\xa0 In fiscal year 2017, the Department awarded nearly $59 million to strengthen drug court programs and combat the opioid epidemic.\\xa0 The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) administers the Department’s “Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Program.”\\xa0 The goals of the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Program are twofold: First, the program aims to reduce opioid misuse and the number of overdose fatalities.\\xa0 Second, the program supports the implementation, enhancement, and proactive use of prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) to support clinical decision-making and prevent the misuse and diversion of controlled substances.\\xa0 Tribes are eligible to apply for a variety of funding opportunities under this program.\\xa0 As an example of recent awards under this program, in Fiscal Year 2017, the Seneca Nation Peacemakers Court was awarded funds to create a community-driven, culturally competent diversion project aimed at helping Native American opioid users.\\xa0 The Port Gamble S’Klallam Tribe was awarded funds in Fiscal Year 2017 to support drug courts and programs that support veterans.\\xa0 The Department will continue to offer these opportunities to Tribes going forward.', 'The Department understands that effective coordination among federal agencies is crucial to ensuring our efforts are successful.\\xa0 We have participated in the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program, funded through the Office of National Drug Control Policy, for many years now. The HIDTA program increases collaboration and information sharing between Tribal law enforcement and federal, state, and local agencies to improve investigation and interdiction in Indian country.\\xa0 As the Department continues to participate in the HIDTA program, our law enforcement agencies, particularly the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), have been working to build stronger relationships with other law enforcement agencies and service providers active in Indian country so that we are able to adjust our Task Force presence in Indian country most effectively.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0', 'The Indian Country Law Enforcement Coordination Working Group, co-chaired by the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) at the Department of the Interior, has become important to enhancing inter-agency federal law enforcement coordination in tribal communities.\\xa0 The group includes representatives from 13 federal law enforcement agencies and has focused heavily on several aspects of the opioid epidemic including proliferation, identifying top challenges to law enforcement, and coordinating responses.\\xa0 We will continue to use this working group to strengthen our coordinated efforts. For example, trafficking through the mail is a significant concern and we intend to use this working group as a forum to develop better ways to stop the movement of opioids through the postal service.\\xa0\\xa0', 'We recognize that the crisis requires more than a law enforcement response, so our efforts to coordinate go beyond law enforcement.\\xa0 For example, the Department is working closely with the Indian Health Service (IHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that other federal agencies are aware of updated Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) protocols in IHS facilities. The updated protocols have an impact on how some drug crimes are investigated and prosecuted, and on efforts to introduce safeguards against opioid abuse.\\xa0 Additionally, we have developed a number of training opportunities to better equip law enforcement and service providers working in Indian country to address the drug crimes and the familial and community impacts of opioid abuse.\\xa0 The Department has presented recent trainings, often in coordination with BIA, on opioid trends, investigative techniques, drug handling precautions regarding opioids, naloxone use, and indicators that opioids are present in a community.\\xa0 Other training is available on violent crime associated with opioids, prescription drug diversion, and investigating and prosecuting medical professionals and others involved in distributing prescription medications outside the scope of legitimate medical practice.\\xa0 These training opportunities are available to Tribal law enforcement and, in some cases, entirely geared for a Tribal audience.\\xa0 The Department is currently working with BIA on a new opportunity tentatively slated for this summer that will bring Tribal law enforcement representatives together with a number of federal law enforcement agencies to train on a wide range of drug-related topics.\\xa0', 'Community outreach is another important aspect of our approach to this issue.\\xa0 The DEA has conducted a prolonged community outreach effort in Indian country to educate Tribal leaders and citizens on opioids and other drugs.\\xa0 Additionally, on October 28, 2017, the Department and BIA collaborated on the most recent Prescription Drug Take Back Day, which is a nationwide program that has also allowed the successful collaboration between BIA and DEA.\\xa0 This initiative provided a safe, convenient, and responsible means of disposing prescription drugs, while also educating Native communities on the potential for opioid abuse.\\xa0 Over 115 Tribal communities participated; we intend to repeat this initiative and expand participation in the future.\\xa0', 'Improved information sharing plays a crucial role in any law enforcement effort, even more so in the context of opioids as we all work to get ahead of this terrible epidemic.\\xa0 The Tribal Access Program for National Crime Information (TAP) is an effective tool for participating Tribes to track and contribute data on opioid-related crimes and to perform required background checks. TAP assists Tribes by providing a means of access to national crime databases maintained by the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division for both criminal justice and civil background check purposes.\\xa0 This has been an especially important tool for performing checks on those who have regular contact with children in Indian country, including schools and foster care.\\xa0 Service providers in Indian country carry much of the burden of healing communities in the wake of opioid abuse, so we believe TAP plays an equally necessary role in ensuring safe providers as it does in sharing important law enforcement information.\\xa0\\xa0', 'The use of data analytics to combat the opioid crisis is among the new tactics that are under development Department-wide.\\xa0 Attorney General Sessions formed the Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit to utilize data analytics, such as distribution and inventory figures, to identify patterns, trends, and statistical outliers that can be developed into targeted law enforcement operations.\\xa0 As we better understand the data across the country we will be able to better understand patterns and trends in Indian country.\\xa0', 'Our goal is clear: we must continue working in partnership with Tribal, federal, state, and local partners to respond to the opioid epidemic and to support communities that are affected by the crisis.\\xa0 We are committed to putting forth our best efforts in this joint undertaking.\\xa0 We appreciate this committee’s focus on this issue and look forward to working with you going forward.

Congress has passed several statutes that provide the Department with the ability to seek capital punishment for certain drug-related crimes. Among these are statutes that punish certain racketeering activities (18 U.S.C. § 1959); the use of a firearm resulting in death during a drug trafficking crime (18 U.S.C. § 924(j)); murder in furtherance of a continuing criminal enterprise (21 U.S.C. § 848(e)); and dealing in extremely large quantities of drugs (18 U.S.C. § 3591(b)(1)).

Department of Justice.\\xa0 As the Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, I oversee approximately 700 attorneys spread across 17 sections and offices, mostly in Washington D.C., but also many stationed in offices around the world.\\xa0 Among other things, prosecutors in the Criminal Division investigate and prosecute transnational organized crime, large-scale international narcotics trafficking, international money laundering, and cyber-related crimes including the use of the dark web to engage in illegal activity.\\xa0 The Criminal Division also houses our Office of International Affairs, which handles all of our foreign legal assistance matters.', 'I am honored today to have the opportunity to speak with this assembly of proud, brave, and accomplished law enforcement officers.\\xa0 This is a critical conference, taking place at this critical time.\\xa0 Today more than ever, we must take stock of not only the successes we have achieved, but more importantly of the hard work that lies ahead of us, as we join together in the ongoing fight against international drug trafficking.\\xa0', 'Our fight against drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations is the very definition of a fight that transcends borders.\\xa0 It is a shared fight.\\xa0 It is a fight against ever-evolving and innovating threats and methods.\\xa0 And it is a fight in which we as law enforcement collectively can, and must, do better.\\xa0', 'The costs have never been higher.\\xa0 Today, in the United States, we are facing the deadliest drug crisis in our history.\\xa0 Approximately 64,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2016.\\xa0 That was the highest drug death toll – and the fastest increase in that death toll – in American history.\\xa0 One American dies of a drug overdose every nine minutes.\\xa0 Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 50.\\xa0', 'These numbers are staggering, but their sheer scale can almost numb us to the reality of profound human loss that the drug crisis is causing.\\xa0 Each one of those deaths is a tragedy that reverberates through families and communities, multiplying its corrosive, debilitating effects.\\xa0 Effects that are borne by the dead, for sure, but also effects that are borne, perhaps more painfully, by the living whom they leave behind.\\xa0 These insidious effects are what make the scourge of opioids, including prescription drugs, heroin, and synthetic drugs like fentanyl, so dangerous and terrifying.\\xa0', 'The traffickers who manufacture and distribute the destructive drugs that are ravaging our communities know precisely what they are doing, and they also are only too aware of our efforts to thwart them.\\xa0 That is why drug traffickers are forging underground marketplaces, exploiting the Internet and cryptocurrencies, and simultaneously challenging the stability and security of our financial institutions.\\xa0 Drug traffickers are moving money to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars in ill-gotten profits.\\xa0 The task for those of us in law enforcement is to not only stanch the flow of drugs, but also the flow of illicit money.\\xa0\\xa0', 'Today, I want to talk about that specific problem: the flow of illicit money.\\xa0 Money is the lifeblood of any criminal organization, be it a pill mill, a transnational drug cartel, or a terrorist organization.\\xa0 Money is the very reason that criminal enterprises exist and persist.\\xa0 If we can map out, and stamp out, the financial networks through which the money is moving, we will go a long way in paralyzing these criminal organizations well before we have to endure, first-hand, the destructive effects of their poisons in our communities.\\xa0', 'How do we stem the tide of illicit money?\\xa0', 'First, we need to follow not just the money, but also the marketplaces.\\xa0 We need to stay one step ahead when it comes to identifying, regulating, tracking, and seizing the marketplaces that criminals are using for their illegal activities.\\xa0 In this day and age, sophisticated criminals are constantly forging and finding new platforms on which they can buy and sell, recruit, and launder.\\xa0 And naturally, markets that operate in the shadows, hidden from law enforcement, are those most appealing to criminals.\\xa0 We need to bring those shadowy markets into the light.', 'The so-called “dark web” is illustrative of this challenge.\\xa0 It is, by its nature, transnational.\\xa0 It relies on anonymity software that masks the true identities of visitors and their locations.\\xa0 It conceals IP addresses.\\xa0 And because of its hidden nature, the dark web is both a haven and a hub for some of the most prolific drug suppliers and criminal actors across the globe.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0', 'Dark web markets have been used to traffic in deadly drugs, illegal weapons, toxic chemicals, stolen identities, stolen credit cards, child pornography, and even people’s credentials for online accounts.\\xa0 With the click of a mouse, you can have synthetic opioids delivered right to your doorstep.\\xa0 And dark web markets have been used to launder hundreds of millions of dollars derived from illegal transactions.\\xa0 Illicit money flows are finding their way into new corners of the Internet each day.', 'The transnational economy of the dark web demands a transnational response.\\xa0 And we are delivering.\\xa0', 'Working closely together with our international partners, we have shut down some of the worst offenders on the dark web.\\xa0 Last July, the U.S. Department of Justice executed the largest takedown of a dark web market in history when we seized AlphaBay.\\xa0 The AlphaBay site was the largest criminal marketplace on the Internet, at its peak hosting upwards of 40,000 vendors, 200,000 users, and 220,000 drug sale listings.\\xa0 We have tied purchases made on AlphaBay to multiple overdose deaths across the United States, including the tragic death of a 13-year-old boy whose classmate purchased a synthetic opioid on AlphaBay.\\xa0', 'With the cooperation of Europol and our host country, the Netherlands, as well as our partners in Thailand, Lithuania, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, we seized AlphaBay’s servers and infrastructure.\\xa0 We froze millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrencies that represented AlphaBay’s illicit proceeds.\\xa0 We arrested the site administrator in Thailand.\\xa0 And we are pursuing his and his wife’s assets throughout the world, from Thailand, Cyprus, and Lichtenstein to Antigua and Barbuda.\\xa0', 'Shortly after the AlphaBay seizure, Dutch authorities, with support from Europol, took down the Hansa marketplace.\\xa0 Hansa was the third largest criminal marketplace on the dark web, also trading high volumes of illegal drugs and goods.\\xa0 The Hansa takedown also was a highly coordinated international operation – and it was an operation carefully designed to maximize impact by seizing and covertly taking over control of Hansa for about a month.\\xa0 This allowed law enforcement to monitor activities on the platform and collect valuable information on significant law enforcement targets who were using the market for criminal purposes.', 'In January of this year, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions created the Joint Criminal Opioid Darknet Enforcement team, known as J-CODE.\\xa0 J-CODE reflects the United States’ recognition that a major driver of the increase in opioid overdose deaths is the growing black market trade of illicit fentanyl and fentanyl analogues on the Internet.\\xa0 J-CODE effectively doubles our investment in the fight against online drug trafficking on the dark web, dedicating dozens more FBI agents, intelligence analysts, and professional staff to this long-term effort.\\xa0 And J-CODE puts an emphasis on the need for international coordination and working with our overseas Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI offices to shut down the dark web markets peddling deadly drugs.', 'Just a few months into its creation, we already have seen successes from the work being done by the J-CODE team.\\xa0 Last week, the Attorney General announced initial results of Operation Disarray, which is the J-CODE’s first coordinated law enforcement operation targeting opioid trafficking on the dark web.\\xa0 During the week of March 27, U.S. law enforcement made eight arrests, conducted more than 160 interviews of people who had bought or sold opioids and other drugs online, identified 19 overdose deaths, and executed numerous search warrants, resulting in the seizure of weapons, drugs, and counterfeit currency.', 'Transnational criminals who wish to take advantage of the perceived secrecy of the dark web should beware:\\xa0 law enforcement is smart to your techniques, and we will labor tirelessly across borders, with the full support of our governments, to dismantle your operations.\\xa0', 'Together, we are inflicting significant blows on dark web markets.\\xa0 And, if we continue to work collectively, we will do more.\\xa0 If we are to keep pace with illegal markets as they shift and grow and change platforms, we too will need to be nimble and adaptive.\\xa0', 'We need to work together to follow the virtual money flows, while being vigilant as we monitor the ever-fluid landscape and features of cryptocurrencies.\\xa0 We need to ensure that we seize not just end products, but the markets themselves.\\xa0 We must target not just the market creator, but the creator’s assets, enablers, and financial network.\\xa0 The very features of markets on the dark web that make them so attractive to bad actors pose a challenge – but also an opportunity – for law enforcement to be smarter, probe deeper, and move faster.\\xa0', 'How else can we stem the tide of illicit money?\\xa0', 'We also need to aggressively combat money laundering, using all tools in our law enforcement toolbox – marrying traditional criminal prosecution with civil forfeiture, financial sanctions, and rigorous enforcement of compliance obligations on financial institutions.', 'As we all know, drug cartels are adept at filtering “dirty” money through various transactions until the funds appear to be “clean” proceeds from legitimate activities, rendering them available for use.\\xa0 This enables criminals to readily mask, move, and access their ill-gotten gains without jeopardizing their illegal activities.\\xa0 They do this through traditional money laundering methods, such as black market peso exchanges, cash couriers, and trade-based money laundering.\\xa0 But they also employ increasingly complex schemes – utilizing shell companies, or transfers through reputable financial institutions, lawyers, and other professionals that enshroud their illegal proceeds in a veneer of legitimacy.\\xa0', 'At the U.S. Department of Justice, we seek to leverage the full panoply of tools at our disposal to combat the means and methods of money launderers.\\xa0 That, of course, includes criminal prosecutions of those who violate our money laundering laws.\\xa0', 'One of our recent investigations, for example, targeted an alleged drug trafficking and money laundering organization largely based in Sinaloa, Mexico.\\xa0 Since at least 2012, the organization allegedly transported massive amounts of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine into the United States.\\xa0 But that was not all; the organization also allegedly smuggled their drug trafficking proceeds from the United States back into Mexico, laundering more than an estimated $100 million dollars.\\xa0 Some money allegedly was laundered through Mexican money exchange houses, while other money allegedly was deposited with U.S. banks and wire-transferred to Mexican accounts controlled by the organization.', 'Our prosecutors brought criminal charges against 15 defendants, including individuals responsible for the movement of the illicit proceeds.\\xa0 To date, eight of those defendants, including the owner of a currency exchange house in Sinaloa and a peso broker operating out of Sinaloa, have pleaded guilty and been sentenced to significant jail time.\\xa0', 'But the law enforcement tools at our disposal are not limited to bringing criminal charges.\\xa0 Take, for example, the case of Jorge Cifuentes-Villa, who is facing criminal prosecution in the United States.\\xa0 Cifuentes-Villa led a drug trafficking and money laundering organization closely tied to the Sinaloa Cartel and he has been designated by the United States as a Consolidated Priority Organization Target, a designation reserved for the most dangerous and prolific narcotics traffickers.\\xa0', 'In addition to the criminal charges against Cifuentes-Villa, our prosecutors also brought two multi-million dollar civil forfeiture actions against assets tied to Cifuentes-Villa’s drug trafficking activities.\\xa0 Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Treasury levied financial sanctions against Cifuentes-Villa, identifying him as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker, to effectively cut him off from transactions with any U.S. persons or businesses.\\xa0', 'The path to civil forfeiture of Cifuentes-Villa’s assets began with a vehicle stop in 2009.\\xa0 A single money courier was found in possession of approximately $780,000 in drug proceeds.\\xa0 With that lead, investigators traced money through various companies’ bank accounts that were used to launder on the cartel’s behalf.\\xa0 They traced the money all the way back to transactions eight years before the vehicle stop.\\xa0 Investigators learned that in 2001, a shell company in the British Virgin Islands had received approximately $11 million in funds. \\xa0And that $11 million subsequently was moved through eight brokerage accounts, before it finally landed in two accounts at Wells Fargo Advisors.\\xa0', 'The tracing showed that the shell company had received the funds from yet another entity in the British Virgin Islands, an entity that was owned by a man who went by the name, Sergio Osuna-Villareal.\\xa0 We identified Sergio Osuna-Villareal as an alias of Jorge Cifuentes-Villa.\\xa0 The investigation revealed that Cifuentes-Villa had transferred more than $10 million in drug proceeds to the shell company as liquidation of the assets of his murdered drug partner.\\xa0 And in 2012, we sought forfeiture – successfully – of both the approximately $11 million from the Wells Fargo Advisors’ accounts and a $1.2 million condominium in Miami, Florida that we also traced to Cifuentes-Villa.\\xa0', 'Those examples underscore the array of tools that we stand ready to deploy against money launderers for drug cartels.\\xa0 With the close cooperation of our international partners, we not only can bring wrongdoers to justice in our courts, but we also can trace where their money traveled and how and when.\\xa0 We can then reclaim their ill-gotten gains, block their assets, and prevent U.S. persons from dealing with them.\\xa0', 'We also must be forward-leaning in holding accountable the enablers that move or legitimize the funds of drug traffickers.\\xa0 Just as cartels zero in on any weak link in the chain – by exploiting financial institutions with ineffective anti-money-laundering protocols – we too will continue to aggressively target financial institutions that turn a blind eye to the mass transit of illicit proceeds through their accounts.', 'To be sure, the examples I have mentioned over the past few minutes barely scratch the surface of the money flows that fuel and refuel the global drug trade.\\xa0 But as with the dark web, the very money laundering tactics that the criminals hope will throw us off should embolden us, focus us, and bring us together.\\xa0', 'And it is by working together that we are able to most effectively target those illicit proceeds.\\xa0 Money laundering mechanisms are transnational by design.\\xa0 The painstaking work by our agents and prosecutors of mapping out those networks necessitates foreign wiretaps, foreign cooperating sources, and foreign law enforcement surveillance.\\xa0 It calls for timely sharing of international financial intelligence and prompt responses to mutual legal assistance requests.\\xa0 It requires foreign agents to authenticate photographs, wiretaps, and seizure evidence, and provide eyewitness testimony.\\xa0 On all these fronts and more, we can and must better synchronize our efforts.\\xa0', 'Drug cartels count on our inability to connect the dots across borders and financial institutions.\\xa0 But with concerted international efforts to target illicit proceeds from every legal angle, we can more effectively connect those very dots and unravel the illicit networks driving the drug crisis.\\xa0', 'Thank you, and I look forward to working with you all.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0']}\n",

The charges carry a potential sentence of life imprisonment because the drugs involved resulted in death, and the defendants’ conduct qualifies for an enhancement under the kingpin statute.', '\\nThe indictment was announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski for the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman for the Northern District of Ohio, Acting Administrator Uttam Dhillon of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Special Agent in Charge Timothy Plancon of DEA’s Detroit Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Steve Francis of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) for Michigan and Ohio and Special Agent in Charge Ryan Korner of IRS Criminal Investigation (CI) Cincinnati Field Office.', '\\n“Fentanyl and its analogues are the number one killer drug in America today, and most of them come from China,” said Attorney General Sessions.\\xa0 “That’s why the Department of Justice under President Donald Trump has taken historic new steps against the threat of Chinese fentanyl. In October, we announced the first-ever indictments of Chinese nationals for fentanyl trafficking; 32 defendants have been charged in those cases. Today we are announcing an indictment of the leaders of the Zheng drug trafficking organization based in China, who the indictment alleges sold drugs that have killed at least two Ohioans. I want to thank U.S. Attorney Herdman and his fabulous Assistant U.S. Attorneys, our Criminal Division, DEA, FBI, Homeland Security Investigations, and IRS Criminal Investigation special agents and our Postal Inspectors for all of their hard work on this case. By cutting off fentanyl and its analogues at the source, we can save American lives.”', '\\n“As detailed in this indictment, the trail from at least two dead bodies in Akron, Ohio, leads to the Zhengs,”\\xa0said U.S. Attorney\\xa0Herdman.\\xa0“This group has shipped deadly fentanyl analogues and other drugs around the globe for a decade.\\xa0Law enforcement will follow the evidence wherever it leads, including overseas, to stop the flow of drugs that have caused so much heartbreak and destruction in Ohio.”', '\\n“DEA will relentlessly pursue anyone shipping deadly fentanyl analogues to the United States wherever they may be and bring them to justice,” said DEA Acting Administrator Dhillon.\\xa0 “These Chinese drug traffickers are directly responsible for the deaths of U.S. citizens and we will hold them accountable in a U.S. court of law.”', '\\n“This case clearly shows that our collaborative efforts with law enforcement at every level continue to have an impact,” said HSI Special Agent in Charge Francis. \\xa0“These efforts exhibit the combined resources of American law enforcement agencies’ resolve to ending this deadly epidemic.”', '\\n“Today’s indictments, which include charges related to the defendants’ smuggling drug profits in and out of the United States, are a victory for the American public and a defeat to drug traffickers everywhere,” said IRS-CI Special Agent in Charge Korner.\\xa0 “The special agents of IRS Criminal Investigation continue in their mission to disrupt the flow of ill-gotten gains that are the life-blood for these criminals.”\\xa0', '\\nAccording to the indictment:', '\\nThe Zhengs and others used numerous companies, including Global United Biotechnology, Golden Chemicals, Golden RC, Cambridge Chemicals, Wonda Science, and others, to manufacture and distribute hundreds of controlled substances, including fentanyl analogues such as carfentanil, acetyl fentanyl, furanyl fentanyl, and others. They created and maintained numerous websites to advertise and sell illegal drugs in more than 35 languages.', '\\nFrom 2008 to the present, the Zheng drug trafficking organization (Zheng DTO) engaged in this conspiracy from its base of operations in Shanghai. The organization claimed to ship “over 16 tonnes of chemicals every month” from its “own laboratory” and to “synthesize nearly any chemical on a bespoke basis in any quantity.”', '\\nThe Zheng DTO touted its ability to create custom-ordered drugs and avoid detection from customs and law enforcement when shipping the drugs. The Zheng DTO explained in emails and online that it had “special ways” to “go through customs safely” in “USA, Russia, Europe,” and other locations around the world.\\xa0 If customs still managed to seize the parcels, the DTO promised it would “re-ship free.”', '\\nThe Zheng DTO used co-conspirators in other countries, including the United States, to receive, repackage, and redistribute the drug shipments, thereby hiding their Chinese origin. For example, it used companies run by Massachusetts-based co-conspirator ', ' to smuggle drugs past customs agents in China and the United States. Wang then shipped the drugs to customers across the country.', '\\nWang has pleaded guilty to his role in the conspiracy and is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 13.', '\\nThe Zheng DTO has sent millions of lethal doses of fentanyl analogues and other drugs linked to overdoses in the United States and around the world.', '\\nOn Feb. 15, 2015, Akron, Ohio resident, Leroy Steele, emailed the Zheng DTO saying he “would like to purchase Acetyl fentanyl.” The Zheng DTO explained in its correspondence with Steele that it was “a professional acetyl fentanyl manufacturer in China” and that “a lot of U.S. and Europe customers purchase largely from us monthly.”\\xa0 The acetyl fentanyl that the Zheng DTO distributed to Steele resulted in the overdose deaths in Ohio of Thomas Rauh, 37, and Carrie Dobbins, 23, on or about March 21 and 28, 2015.', '\\nSteele was subsequently convicted of drug offenses and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.', '\\nDespite the deadly consequences of its actions, the Zheng DTO continued manufacturing and distributing drugs. In 2015, it advertised that it delivered “to all 50 USA states” and “worldwide to Australia, Europe, Asia and Africa.”', '\\nWhen China would ban a synthetic narcotic, the Zheng DTO would use its chemical expertise to create an analogue of the drug with a slightly different chemical structure but the same or even more potent effect. In this manner, the DTO entirely bypassed China’s restrictions on international narcotics sales.\\xa0', '\\nLast month, the Zheng DTO agreed to manufacture adulterated cancer medication, creating counterfeit pills that replaced the active cancer-fighting ingredient with dangerous synthetic drugs. It also created and shipped counterfeit Adderall pills that were adulterated with deadly bath salts.', '\\nThe Zheng DTO laundered its drug proceeds by using digital currency such as Bitcoin, transmitted drug proceeds into and out of bank accounts in China and Hong Kong, and bypassed currency restrictions and reporting requirements.', \"\\nIf convicted, the defendant’s sentence will be determined by the Court after review of factors unique to this case, including the defendant’s prior criminal record, if any, the defendant's role in the offense and the characteristics of the violation.\\xa0 In all cases, the sentence will not exceed the statutory maximum and in most cases it will be less than the maximum.\", '\\nThis investigation was conducted by the DEA, HSI, and IRS-CI. The following agencies assisted in the investigation: U.S. Postal Inspection Service, FBI, Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force, Special Operations Division, the Medway Drug Task Force, Akron Police Department, federal law enforcement on assignment at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and federal law enforcement in the following districts: District of Massachusetts, Middle District of Florida, District of Colorado, District of Missouri, District of Minnesota and Western District of Texas. The Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs provided assistance.\\xa0 The Chinese Ministry of Public Security provided assistance during the course of the investigation.', '\\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Matthew J. Cronin of the Northern District of Ohio and Justice Department Criminal Division Trial Attorneys Adrienne Rose of the Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section and Deputy Unit Chief Stephen Sola of the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, are prosecuting the case.', '\\nAn indictment is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt.\\xa0 A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government’s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.']}\n",

I especially want to thank our law enforcement partners like the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs’ Association, the Major City Chiefs Association, the IACP, and so many others from all over the country who are here. Thank you for your service to this country and for keeping us all safe.', '“As any of these law enforcement partners will tell you and as President Trump knows well, civil asset forfeiture is a key tool that helps law enforcement defund organized crime, take back ill-gotten gains, and prevent new crimes from being committed, and it weakens the criminals and the cartels. Even more importantly, it helps return property to the victims of crime. Civil asset forfeiture takes the material support of the criminals and instead makes it the material support of law enforcement, funding priorities like new vehicles, bulletproof vests, opioid overdose reversal kits, and better training. In departments across this country, funds that were once used to take lives are now being used to save lives.', '“It also removes the instrumentalities of crimes, such as illegal firearms, ammunition, explosives and property associated with child pornography from criminals—preventing them from being able to use these tools in further criminal acts.', '“President Trump has directed this Department of Justice to reduce crime in this country, and we will use every lawful tool that we have to do that. We will continue to encourage civil asset forfeiture whenever appropriate in order to hit organized crime in the wallet.', '“At the same time, we must protect the rights of the people we serve. Law-abiding people whose property is used without their knowledge or without their consent should not be punished because of crimes that others have committed.', '“Now, let me just say, in the vast majority of cases, this is not an issue. Our law enforcement officers do an incredible job. In fact, over the last decade, four out of five administrative civil asset forfeitures filed by federal law enforcement agencies were never challenged in court.', '“Even so, we must take every precaution to protect the rights of claimants in that small minority of cases.', '“And so today, the Department of Justice is issuing legal guidance that will clarify DOJ policy on the adoption of seized assets. It will return us to longstanding DOJ policy—and also provide additional, supplemental protections for law-abiding Americans. This will make us more effective at bankrupting organized criminals and at safeguarding the property of law-abiding Americans.', '“Under today’s guidance, the federal government will not adopt seized property unless the state or local agency involved provides information demonstrating that the seizure was justified by probable cause. We will accomplish this through a new adoption form that state and local law enforcement must fill out before we will agree to adopt any property, which will include the necessary information to allow Department lawyers to carefully review and determine whether adoption is proper. Further, law enforcement agencies who wish to participate in the Department’s Equitable Sharing Program now must now provide their officers with enhanced training on asset forfeiture laws.', '“The Department will adopt smaller seizures of cash—between $5,000 and $10,000—only if there exists some level of criminality or with the express concurrence of the U.S. Attorney’s office.', '“When I was in the Senate, I worked with Senator Schumer to make modifications to the civil asset forfeiture program. We required probable cause for the seizure of property. And we raised the burden on the government, who has the initial burden in all of these cases, to the same preponderance of the evidence standard used in all civil cases. In addition, if the government lost the case, then the government pays attorneys’ fees. I believe those were good reforms that strengthened the program.', '“Further, to better protect claimants, the Department will expedite the review of civil asset forfeiture cases. State and local law enforcement agencies requesting federal adoption must do so within 15 calendar days following the date of seizure. The adopting federal agency must then send notice to interested parties within 45 days of the date of seizure. This is twice as fast of a review as is required by statute. This streamlined process will ensure that people receive speedy resolutions of their cases, and that rightful owners will get their property back as soon as possible.', '“In addition to these safeguards on federal adoptions, I am asking Department attorneys to proceed with an abundance of caution when handling all forfeitures involving vehicles and especially residences. I think that Department attorneys should think hard before they agree to forfeit these types of property, or waive any asset thresholds associated with them. Just like with cash seizures, if we operate this program in a careful and responsible way, something I believe the American people expect and deserve with a program such as this, the Department’s federal asset forfeiture program will be an effective tool, while at the same time protecting the rights of property owners.', '“Finally, I am directing agencies and components adopting seized property to prioritize assets that will most effectively advance our overall goal of reducing violent crime. We need to send clear message that crime does not pay.', '“This policy is effective immediately and applies to all new requests for adoption.', '“With this new policy, the American people can be confident knowing that we are taking action to defund criminals and at the same time protecting the rights of law-abiding people.”']}\n",

That will be the highest drug death toll and the fastest increase in that death toll in American history. This is not a sustainable trend nor an acceptable America.', 'This crisis is being driven primarily by opioids—prescription drugs, heroin, and synthetic drugs like fentanyl.', 'According to the New England Journal of Medicine, we’re seeing more availability, higher purity, and lower price. They’re lacing heroin and cocaine with fentanyl—a drug 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin. As a result, the drugs on the street are now more powerful, more addictive, and more dangerous than ever. And they’re not just dangerous for users: even being accidently exposed to just a few grains of fentanyl can kill a police officer or paramedic.', 'Sadly, this was almost the case just a couple months ago in East Liverpool, Ohio when Officer Chris Green brushed off a few grains of white powder from his shirt an hour after a traffic stop and fell to the floor. Luckily, he was in his squad room and they got to him immediately. As his police chief said, “if he would have been alone, he would have been dead.” Or imagine if he’d gone straight home that day to give his kids a hug? These are terrifying thoughts for our law enforcement.', 'To confront a crisis on this scale, we must take a comprehensive approach to the problem. There are three components: prevention, enforcement, and treatment.', 'Treatment is important. In some cases, treatment can help break the cycle of addiction and crime and help people get their lives back together.', 'But treatment alone is not enough. Treatment often comes too late. By the time many people receive treatment, they, their families, and communities have already suffered so much. The struggle to overcome addiction can be a long process – and it can fail. And not only can it fail, it very often fails.', 'In recent years, some of the government officials in this country have sent mixed messages about the harmfulness of drugs. We must not capitulate intellectually or morally to drug use. We must create a culture that is hostile to drug abuse. We know this can work. It has worked in the past for drugs, but also for cigarettes and seatbelts. A campaign was mounted, it took time, and it was effective. We need to send such a clear message now.', 'The Department of Justice has been working diligently to improve our prevention efforts. We are doing that through raising awareness, through drug take-back programs, and through DEA’s 360 Strategy program – Dayton was recently announced as a 2017 pilot city.', 'Prevention is what we at the Department do every day—because enforcement is prevention. Enforcing our laws helps keep drugs out of our country, decrease their availability, drive up their price, and reduce their purity and addictiveness.', 'DEA tells us that 80 percent of heroin addiction starts with prescription drug addiction. We must stop the abuse of prescription drugs.', 'Earlier this month, the Department announced the largest health care fraud takedown in American history. DOJ coordinated the efforts of more than 1,000 state and federal law enforcement agents to arrest more than 400 defendants. More than 50 of these defendants were doctors and have been charged with opioid-related crimes, which means this was also the largest opioid-related fraud takedown in American history.', 'And, just a week after we made that announcement, we announced the seizure and take down of AlphaBay— the largest dark net marketplace takedown in history. This site hosted some 220,000 drug sale listings and was responsible for countless synthetic opioid overdoses, including the tragic death of a 13 year old in Utah.', 'These efforts build on the good work that U.S. Attorney Glassman and the Department have accomplished here. In late January, a doctor from New Albany, Ohio pled guilty to maintaining a clinic as a front for drug trafficking. He forfeited more than $29 million in seized assets from illegal drug trafficking.', 'A few months later, in April, a doctor from Portsmouth, Ohio, pled guilty to conspiring to distribute a controlled substance through a pain clinic. For six years, the clinic saw more than 20 patients a day, who each paid at least $200 in cash. At one point the defendant even opened her own dispensary at the clinic, so she could fill her own prescriptions for desperate patients.', 'These cases are beginning to roll in from all over the country.', 'On behalf of the Department, I want to say thank you to U.S. Attorney Glassman and everyone who worked on these cases. You have made this Department proud—and more importantly, you have made the people of Ohio safer.', 'And we can and must do more. Which is why today, we are announcing a new effort to target our federal resources against this epidemic. If you are a doctor illegally prescribing opioids for profit or a pharmacist letting these pills walk out the door and onto our streets based on prescriptions you know were obtained under false pretenses, we are coming after you. We will reverse these devastating trends with every tool we have.', \"First, I am announcing a new data analytics program – the Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit. I have created this unit to focus specifically on opioid-related health care fraud using data to identify and prosecute individuals that are contributing to this opioid epidemic. This sort of data analytics team can tell us important information about prescription opioids—like which physicians are writing opioid prescriptions at a rate that far exceeds their peers; how many of a doctor's patients died within 60 days of an opioid prescription; the average age of the patients receiving these prescriptions; pharmacies that are dispensing disproportionately large amounts of opioids; and regional hot spots for opioid issues.\", 'With this data in hand, I am also assigning 12 experienced prosecutors to focus solely on investigating and prosecuting opioid-related health care fraud cases in a dozen locations around the country where we know enforcement will make a difference in turning the tide on this epidemic. These prosecutors, working with FBI, DEA, HHS, as well as our state and local partners, will help us target and prosecute these doctors, pharmacies, and medical providers who are furthering this epidemic to line their pockets. These prosecutors will be based in several states across the country, including Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee, and right here in Southern Ohio.', 'With these new resources, we will be better positioned to identify, prosecute, and convict some of the individuals contributing to these tens of thousands of deaths a year. The Department is determined to attack this opioid epidemic, and I believe these resources will make a difference.', 'And I issue a plea to all physicians, dentists, pharmacists: slow down. First do no harm.', 'These efforts will make all of us safer—and not just from the threat of drug addiction. They also help us reduce violence in our communities.', 'Drug trafficking is an inherently violent business. If you want to collect a drug debt, you can’t file a lawsuit in court. You collect it by the barrel of a gun.', 'By putting traffickers behind bars and reducing the supply of dangerous drugs, we will prevent much of the violence that is associated with drug dealing.', 'We also have to recognize that most of the heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, and fentanyl in this country got here across our Southern border. Under President Trump’s strong leadership, the federal government is finally getting serious about securing our borders. Illegal entries are down 50 percent already and the wall has not even gone up.', 'We have also seen steep decreases in drug prices on the street. But the price we have paid as a country has only gone up. If you ask the economists, they’ll tell you that prescription opioid addiction costs our economy some $78 billion a year and other illicit drugs cost us another $193 billion a year. Remember, many of these drugs are paid for by private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, and the VA. But what is even more devastating is the price we have paid in broken relationships, broken lives, and death rates the likes of which we have never seen before.', 'In the face of the worst drug crisis in our history, we need to use every lawful tool we have. But I’m convinced this is a winnable war. We will be calling on America’s great physicians and health care workers to take special care with addictive drugs. And in order to win, we are committing more Department of Justice resources to combat this epidemic, as well as continue to work to strengthen our partnerships with you—law enforcement on the front lines.', 'Let me ask you to do a simple thing: after every arrest for illegal possession of an illegal prescription, make every effort to get the arrestee to tell you where he or she got the drugs. We did that in Mobile and it led us to the two biggest sources in town. We need to hammer these illegal suppliers. You are ultimately the most effective resources that we as a country have in this effort. You have a tough job, but it’s a job worth doing.', 'But you can also know this: you have our thanks and this Department of Justice will always have your back. Thank you.']}\n",

The date of sentencing has not been set.', 'At the plea hearing, Vivas Ceron admitted that between 2013 and 2017, Chinese sources of supply shipped several hundred pounds of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues to the United States and Canada. \\xa0Vivas Ceron and members of his conspiracy imported these opioids into the United States and distributed them to their customers around the country. Vivas Ceron ran his drug trafficking organization from a jail cell in Canada, and he concealed his identity to facilitate the conspiracy by using aliases, encrypted WICKR accounts, and numerous email addresses. Vivas Ceron and his co-conspirators’ distribution in Canada and the United States resulted in 15 overdoses in North Dakota, Oregon, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Rhode Island, including four fatal overdoses, one of which was Grand Forks resident 18-year-old Bailey Henke.', '“From a Canadian jail cell, Daniel Vivas Ceron directed a deadly drug ring that fueled the opioid epidemic and took the lives of four Americans,” said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. \\xa0“Today’s guilty plea brings some measure of justice for the victims and families that fell prey to Vivas Ceron’s dangerous organization and its tragic track record of spreading addiction and abuse.”\\xa0', '“Ultimate justice can seem elusive in a case with such a wide swath of destruction.\\xa0 The defendant and his co-conspirators built themselves an organization that made them into regional, national and international merchants of death, and today’s guilty plea is an important milestone in the quest for justice on behalf of those who died and those who were injured by the defendant’s ruinous quest for profits,” said U.S Attorney Wrigley.\\xa0 “I want to personally commend the team of prosecutors and investigators who worked so ably across the nation and globe to make today’s guilty plea possible.\\xa0 We will work assiduously to secure a sentence that reflects the light of justice on the far-reaching damage done to innumerable victims, families and communities,”', '“Daniel Vivas Ceron’s heinous crimes have caused unthinkable pain and anguish for dozens of people in Oregon and far beyond, including four victims who lost their lives to fatal overdoses,” said U.S. Attorney Williams.\\xa0 “At a time when our country desperately tries to free itself from the painful grip of the opioid crisis, criminals like Ceron and his more than 20 co-defendants are seeking to profit off addiction and death.\\xa0 The tragic irony of crime is that while Ceron will continue to live out his life in prison or beyond, four of his victims will not.\\xa0 The damage he caused is permanent.\\xa0 We cannot forget that.”', '“My heart goes out to the friends and families of those who lost their lives as a result of the greed and selfishness of all of the individuals involved in this case,” said Special Agent in Charge Brad Bench of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Seattle, Washington. \\xa0“The amount of cooperation between HSI and our state, federal, and international partners was invaluable to halting the deadly actions of this complex drug organization.

not take appropriate measures to ensure that patients did not divert or abuse controlled substances. \\xa0The plea agreement summarizes an interaction with a patient, which was captured on video.

gracious introduction.\\xa0 It’s a pleasure to be here in the great State of Alaska to participate in the Alaska Wellness Summit 2.0.', 'I also want to thank Senator Sullivan for his leadership in convening this important event, along with everyone whose hard work went into organizing it.', 'Senator Sullivan is a long-time public servant and former Attorney General of Alaska, and I know he has a great appreciation for our men and women in law enforcement.\\xa0\\xa0', 'It is also a pleasure to be here with my friend and colleague, U.S. Attorney Bryan Schroder, who is doing a tremendous job leading the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Alaska.\\xa0\\xa0', 'U.S. Attorney Schroder and I have worked together on violent crime issues and I applaud his leadership in Alaska’s law enforcement community.\\xa0', 'As this event recognizes, crime—especially violent crime—remains a significant problem throughout our country, including here in Alaska.', 'We also face an ongoing crisis involving opioids and other dangerous drugs.\\xa0\\xa0', 'We have violent gangs terrorizing communities across our country.', 'Criminals in the United States and overseas are targeting Americans in financial fraud schemes that destroy people’s hard earned savings, often taking a particular toll on our seniors.', 'Cyber criminals are stealing our private information, hacking into our online accounts, and stealing intellectual property from our businesses.', 'And criminals are coming up with new schemes every day to steal taxpayer dollars from our federal health care programs, like Medicare, Medicaid, and the TRICARE program that provides healthcare to our military families.', 'But we are making progress.', 'Under the leadership of President Trump and Attorney General Sessions, we are taking an all-hands approach to law enforcement.', 'Last June, Attorney General Sessions announced the largest surge in federal prosecutors in decades.\\xa0 Across the country, we are hiring more federal prosecutors, including right here in Alaska.', 'In the Criminal Division at the Justice Department, where I work, we recently marked a particularly important milestone—our Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, was just confirmed by the U.S. Senate a few weeks ago.\\xa0\\xa0', 'Under his leadership, we will continue the Division’s commitment to the rule of law and protecting our citizens, working more closely than ever with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners.', 'Partners like the Coast Guard, which under Admiral Shultz is our primary defense to drug smuggling on the high seas and which works closely with DOJ’s Narcotic and Dangerous Drugs Section.', 'DOJ is working with State Attorneys General, like Jahna Lindemuth, not only to investigate and prosecute cases, but also to educate the public and prevent crime through programs such as our Elder Justice Initiative.\\xa0 Under that initiative, which was announced by Attorney General Sessions in February, we now have an Elder Justice Coordinator in each of our 93 U.S. Attorney’s Offices, including here in Alaska.', 'I know this is a particularly important issue for U.S. Attorney Schroder as well, who has made it a priority to prosecute elder fraud cases, working together with FBI, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the State of Alaska’s Office of Elder Fraud and Assistance.', 'Just this past December, his office secured a 10-year sentence against a Washington State man who defrauded Alaskans out of approximately 2.7 million dollars as part of an advance-fee scheme that preyed upon the sick and elderly.', 'In connection with the focus on elder justice that I just mentioned, this February Attorney General Sessions announced the coordination of a nationwide elder fraud sweep that involved approximately 200 criminal defendants who were engaged in a variety of fraud schemes, ranging from mass mailing to telemarketing and investment scams, targeting seniors in Alaska and around the nation.', 'In my current role as Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Department’s Criminal Division, I am tasked with overseeing the Organized Crime and Gang Section.\\xa0 I’m in a position to see all of the great work that our 700 federal prosecutors in the Criminal Division are doing each day to protect the American people across the country, often with prosecutors in U.S. Attorney’s Offices, and with federal, state and local law enforcement, to bring violent gang members to justice—members of gangs like MS-13.', 'Fighting violent crime is a top priority of this Attorney General and this Administration—and I know it’s a priority for all of our citizens, and particularly for the people of Alaska.\\xa0 Between 2014 and 2016, the national violent crime rate increased by around seven percent, and the murder rate went up by roughly 20 percent.\\xa0 As of the most recent FBI statistics, in 2016, Alaska had the highest rate of violent crime per capita of any state at approximately 800 offenses per 100,000 persons.', 'Under U.S. Attorney Schroder, the U.S. Attorney’s Office here has doubled down in its efforts against violent crime.\\xa0 Bottom line is that Bryan’s office went from 154 violent crime cases filed in calendar year 2016, to 186 cases filed in calendar year 2017.\\xa0 That’s a 20.7 percent increase.\\xa0 The number of defendants charged went up even more, from 198 in calendar year 2016, to 243 in calendar year 2017, a 22.7 percent increase.\\xa0\\xa0', 'In October last year, he announced the Office’s Anti-Violent Crime Strategy, which brings together city, state, and federal authorities to combat rising crime in Alaska.\\xa0 He did it as part of the Attorney General’s October 2017 renewal of “Project Safe Neighborhoods,” a nationwide program that partners federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.', 'A key part of the anti-violent crime strategy here in Alaska involves greater collaboration with local law enforcement.\\xa0 Here in Anchorage, the FBI has assigned a Special Agent to work full time with the Anchorage Police Department’s homicide unit.', 'The Anchorage Police Department is also using the Integrated Ballistic Identification System, a national system hosted by the ATF that allows local law enforcement to quickly enter ballistics information and search against evidence from their jurisdiction, neighboring ones, and others across the country.', 'I’d like to switch gears now and address a few of the other significant threats to public safety and public health that Attorney General Sessions has made a priority for federal prosecutors.', 'Health Care Fraud.', 'We’re working to protect the federal health care system that benefits Alaskans and all Americans.\\xa0 The success of the Department’s approach to health care fraud was on full display a few weeks ago when Attorney General Sessions and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Azar announced the largest ever health care fraud enforcement action in history.', 'This year’s takedown involved charges against 601 defendants across 58 federal districts, including 165 doctors, nurses and other licensed medical professionals, for their alleged participation in health care fraud schemes involving more than $2 billion in false billings.\\xa0 These are cases that impact every American taxpayer.\\xa0 When a criminal in Miami steals money from Medicare, it impacts taxpayers in Anchorage.', 'As a result of our focus on health care fraud, in Miami and Detroit, we have seen a 20 percent drop in Medicare Part A and B billings.\\xa0 That amounts to over $2 billion in savings for all taxpayers annually.', 'Just as important as the fraud charges, 162 defendants, including 57 medical professionals, were charged for their roles in prescribing and distributing opioids and other dangerous narcotics.', 'The opioid epidemic has hit Alaska hard.', 'Admissions for treatment of opioid abuse increased almost 60 percent in 2014.\\xa0 Recent data show that over 200,000 Alaskans out of a state population of around 740,000, obtained prescriptions Schedule 2 controlled substances, including opioids—that’s 27 percent of the population.\\xa0 According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, approximately 80 percent of heroin users reported starting their addiction with these kinds of prescription opioid painkillers.\\xa0 \\xa0', 'While the majority of those opioids were initially prescribed in good faith by doctors trying to do right by their patients, the data indicate that there is unfortunately no shortage of medical professionals only too willing to prescribe opioids for any reason, or for no reason all—and that’s a crime.\\xa0\\xa0', 'By investigating and prosecuting corrupt doctors and pharmacists who are illegally prescribing and distributing prescription opioids, we can stem the flow of these dangerous narcotics onto our streets.\\xa0 As we reduce the flow of prescription opioids, we seek to prevent the next generation of addicts.', 'We are also attacking other cases involving opioids, including by charging suppliers in China who are manufacturing deadly fentanyl that is being sold over the internet to people in the United States.', 'And we continue our work in dismantling drug trafficking organizations and cartels that continue to flood our streets with deadly poisons here and in the lower 48.', 'On the cyber and child exploitation front, in April of this year, the Department announced charges against seven individuals and the seizure of Backpage.com, the internet’s leading forum for prostitution ads, including ads advertising the prostitution of children.\\xa0 Backpage was allegedly used as a platform that allowed human traffickers to thrive.', 'Also this year, prosecutors in our Organized Crime and Gang section charged 36 cybercriminals from the United States and 17 countries on five continents who participated in a transnational cyber enterprise called “Infraud.”\\xa0', 'Members of the Infraud Organization used the forum to coordinate and conduct online criminal activities that included identity theft, bank fraud, wire fraud and computer crimes, resulting in more than $530 million in losses to financial institutions, merchants, and private individuals in all 50 states.', 'Our prosecutors work day and night, across the country, side by side with our law enforcement partners, as we tackle these problems that are so important to the Department, the people of Alaska, and the nation.', 'While many of our investigations are taken out of the public eye, know that we are here, we are dedicated, and we will not waiver in our mission of protecting the American public.\\xa0 Our goal is simple—we will use every lawful tool available to ensure that our citizens, our businesses, and our country can thrive, without fear of crime.', 'As federal prosecutors, we are not here to fill up the prisons or manage crime — that’s not our goal.\\xa0 Our goal is to reduce crime — to bend that trend curve downward in Alaska and across the nation.', 'Thank you for your time today.\\xa0 I look forward to the remainder of the program.']}\n",

Fourteen were arrested this morning; the rest were arrested earlier in the week or were already in custody. Authorities are continuing to search for seven defendants; two are in Mexico. Many of the defendants are scheduled to be arraigned before U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen S. Crawford at 2:00 p.m. today and tomorrow.', 'The yearlong investigation was led by the North County Regional Gang Task Force. It involved months of federal wiretaps, dozens of undercover drug and gun buys and extensive surveillance. Many of the defendants are documented members or associates of violent North County street gangs, including the Vista Home Boys, Varrio Fallbrook Locos, Varrio Carlsbad Locos, Encinitas Tortilla Flats, Varrio San Marcos and Escondido Viejo Diablos.', 'According to charging documents, the defendants were involved in a variety of crimes, including drug distribution, firearms trafficking, robberies, vehicle thefts, burglaries and assaults.', 'In total, authorities seized heroin, methamphetamine and 25 firearms, including handguns, revolvers and assault rifles. These drugs and guns were being stored and sold in our North County neighborhoods, including across the street from Vista High School.', 'The charging documents describe a trafficking organization allegedly led by a Mexico-based woman who used dozens of street gang members to distribute heroin. Defendant Yadira “Pini” Villalvazo attended Vista High School and was an associate of Vista Home Boys street gang before she was deported following a federal drug trafficking conviction in 2002. According to charging documents, Villalvazo is now running her own Sinaloa Cartel-linked organization from Tijuana. Her specialty is still heroin.', 'According to court records, this drug trafficking organization supplied at least 25 percent of the heroin sold and consumed in North County and grossed tens of thousands of dollars in proceeds that were sent back to Mexico. The Villalvazo network distributed heroin in North County and also supplied pound quantities of heroin to a prolific distribution ring in Kingman.', 'During this investigation, the gang task force also targeted major methamphetamine distribution cells connected to North County street gangs, including rings allegedly led by Sabrina Yzaguirre, Ivan Bazan, aka “Dreamer” and Jorge Enrique Jara Cervantes, aka “Scorpion.” In addition, the ring allegedly led by Jara shipped pound quantities of methamphetamine for distribution in Alabama and Tennessee.', 'Heroin deaths in San Diego County more than doubled in the last decade, from 40 in 2005 to 90 in 2015. And this is despite the use of naloxone, which first responders have used to save countless lives. In 2015 alone, paramedics used naloxone 1,340 times. Heroin treatment admissions have risen every year in San Diego County since 2011.', 'Meth-related deaths increased more than 80% between 2011 and 2015. And about half of adults arrested in 2015 tested positive for meth at the time of their arrest.', '“Today we’ve taken out one of North County’s largest heroin suppliers,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Alana Robinson. “This crackdown is our most significant response to date to the heroin epidemic ravaging our communities. We anticipate seeing a huge impact now that these defendants are removed from our community, particularly in the North County cities of Oceanside, Vista, San Marcos and other areas plagued by gangs.”', \"“The Sheriff's Department is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to keep the influence of drugs and gangs away from our children and out of our community,” said County Sheriff Bill Gore of San Diego, California.\", 'Special Agent in Charge Eric S. Birnbaum of the FBI stated, “This investigation demonstrates the complex, international and multi-faceted nature of the gang threat in North County where heroin, methamphetamine and firearms related crimes threaten our communities. The FBI will continue to work tirelessly alongside our law enforcement partners at the North County Regional Gang Task Force to restore these neighborhoods to the good citizens who live in them.”', \"Acting U.S. Attorney Robinson praised the task force for the coordinated team effort in the culmination of this investigation. Agents and officers from the FBI, San Diego County Sheriff's Office, Oceanside Police Department, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Bureau of Prisons and Homeland Security Investigations. U.S. Marshals Service, California Highway Patrol and the Escondido and Carlsbad Police Departments collaborated on this investigation. Attorneys from the Department of Justice, Office of Enforcement Operations, Electronic Surveillance Unit, also provided critical assistance to the investigation.\", 'This case is also the result of the ongoing efforts by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) a partnership that brings together the combined expertise and unique abilities of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.

Elmer, 64, of Fishers, Indiana, and Caprice R. Bearden, 62, of Carmel, Indiana, were charged in a 10-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, three counts of distributing an adulterated drug in interstate commerce and six counts of adulterating drugs while held for sale after shipment of a drug component in interstate commerce. Elmer was arrested yesterday and had his initial court appearance in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Indiana where he pleaded not guilty and was released under conditions imposed by the Court. Trial has been scheduled for Aug. 21 at 9 a.m.', '“The distribution of over- and under-potent drug products poses a serious risk of harm to patients,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad A. Readler of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “FDA’s efforts to ensure the safety of compounded drugs is critically important. Impeding FDA’s ability to do its job and uncover these types of safety concerns will not be tolerated. The Justice Department is committed to working with FDA to protect patients and ensure compounded drugs are safe.”', '“These defendants put greed and the reputation of their company ahead of the health and safety of our most innocent victims,” said U.S. Attorney Josh Minkler for the Southern District of Indiana. “Their actions put lives in danger and they will be held accountable.”', 'Elmer owned and was the President of Pharmakon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Pharmakon), and Bearden was the company’s Director of Compliance. Pharmakon compounded drugs at a facility in Noblesville, Indiana for customers in Indiana and many other states.', 'The indictment alleges that from July 2013 through mid-February 2016, Bearden received approximately 70 potency test failure notices from companies used by Pharmakon to test for potency, indicating that drugs such as morphine sulfate and fentanyl were either under- or over-potent. According to the indictment, Bearden discussed the out-of-specification test results with Elmer, a licensed pharmacist, and until Pharmakon compounded over potent morphine sulfate in February 2016, Elmer determined that Pharmakon should not contact any individuals or entities – including hospitals – who received the drugs, nor conduct any product recalls before FDA intervention.', 'On several occasions, according to the indictment, infants were injected with drugs compounded by Pharmakon - that were significantly over-potent. For example, the indictment alleges that in early February 2016, Pharmakon distributed over potent morphine sulfate, an opioid typically used for relief of moderate to severe acute and chronic pain, to a hospital in Indiana and a hospital in Illinois. As alleged in the indictment, three infants at the hospital in Indiana received the morphine sulfate which was nearly 25 times the strength indicated on its label, and one infant was taken by emergency helicopter to a nearby children’s hospital.', 'Further, as alleged in the indictment, during FDA inspections of Pharmakon in 2014 and 2016, Bearden lied about Pharmakon’s never having received any out-of-specification drug potency test results. According to the indictment, Elmer learned of Bearden’s lies during or shortly after the FDA’s inspections and took no action to correct her and to inform the FDA of the extent of Pharmakon’s drug potency failures. The indictment alleges that Elmer and Bearden conspired to defraud the United States by interfering with and obstructing the lawful functions of the FDA, and obstructing, influencing and impeding FDA inspections. In addition, as alleged, during the 2016 inspection, Elmer directed at least one Pharmakon employee to backdate batch records of compounded drugs.', '“Companies that do not meet federal manufacturing standards, especially when dealing with highly potent drugs like fentanyl meant for vulnerable populations, put the health and safety of American consumers at great risk,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “The FDA and our Office of Criminal Investigations will continue to pursue and help bring to justice those companies who put the public health at risk.”', 'According to the indictment, during two inspections of Pharmakon in 2014, FDA observed conditions that did not comply with FDA regulations. The indictment alleges that Elmer and Bearden failed to investigate the root causes of the drug potency failures and otherwise failed to make changes in Pharmakon’s compounding operations to reduce the incidence of these failures. Instead, as alleged in the indictment, under the direction and supervision of Elmer and Bearden, Pharmakon continued to distribute under- and over-potent drugs, shipping these drugs before receiving the potency test results.', 'The conspiracy charge carries a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or gross loss from the offense. The charges of distributing an adulterated drug in interstate commerce and adulterating drugs while held for sale after shipment of a drug component in interstate commerce each carry a statutory maximum punishment of one year in prison and a fine of $100,000 or twice the gross gain or gross loss from the offense.', 'Acting Assistant Attorney General Readler and U.S. Attorney Minkler commended the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, which conducted the investigation. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Cindy J. Cho, of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana and Trial Attorney David A.
